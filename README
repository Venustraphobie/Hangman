# Hangman

This simple, console-based game lets users play a classic game of Hangman. It includes several features to enhance the gameplay experience, making it visually engaging and easy to use.

## Key Features

- Random Word Selection: The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, ensuring a different word for each game.
- Hangman Display: Provides visual feedback by drawing the hangman figure with each incorrect guess, making the game more interactive.
- Guess Tracking: Displays correctly guessed letters in their positions while showing underscores for letters yet to be guessed.

This project took a while to complete (procrastination might have played a part), but I hope you enjoy playing this program as much as I enjoyed building it!
